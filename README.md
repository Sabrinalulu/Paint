# Paint
GUI PRACTICE (Java/Eclipse)
There are a canvas and two tool bars. Users can draw line, oval, rectangle directly and choose three different size of brush to paint. A checkbox to decide whether a graph is filled up with color or not and a button to clear any paints on canvas are essential too. At the bottom of the paint window displays the coordinates of mouse,  which tools are being used, and the status of mouse on the canvas.
